    <p>
      This website is for me to take notes throughout my web design class, not only so I don't have to physically take notes, but also so that I have clear examples of what each code (tag) does!

      <h2><font color="purple">Making Sections and Nesting Elements</font></h2>
      <article>
        <p>
         This paragraph is in a section, it helps to break up the website into "chunks" and keep elements which belong together, in the same area. Notice how in VS Code, there are little faint lines infront of all of my tags? That means they are "nested" into the tag that is above it. As you can see in this html document, 
         The nesting process goes: 
        </p>

      <h2><font color="purple">How to Commit to Main</font></h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          This section is all about commiting my work to the main. Commiting to the main means: once I'm all done working on my html document "locally" (meaning offline, in VS Code), I need to open the repository in GitHub Desktop, and click "commit to main", then click "push to origin".

      <h2><font color="purple">Navigation/Linking to Other Pages</font></h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          This section is about linking different websites, and other html pages in one document. This is a method where on the live website, you can click on word(s) and it will automatically "send you" to a page of my choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm going to display how to link an already exsisting website, and have it open in a new tab.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>

        <p>
          I'm also going to display how to open a different html page that I created in this file.
        </p>
        <a href="navigation.html">Navigation Link Page</a>

        <p>
          Here is how you'd create a navigation system, linking multiple different pages, set up as a menu.
        </p>

        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="navigation links/navigation-link-1.html">Navigation Link 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="navigation links/navigation-link-2.html">Navigation Link 2</a></li>
            <li><a href="navigation links/navigation-link-3.html">Navigation Link 3</a></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
        <p>
          *Remember* when using the links tag, make sure if you're linking to a page/site that's located in a different folder then your index.html, use "../" to go back out of your current folder, then type in the one you want to go into.

      <h2><font color="purple">Visual Components</font></h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          This section includes all things visual, like font sizing, colouring, lists and other visual elements.
        </p>
        
        <h3><font color="orange">Using the colour tag!</font></h3>
        <h3><strong>Using the Bold (strong) tag!</strong></h3>
        <h3><em>Using the Italics (emphasis) tag!</em></h3>
        <p>
          This is how to properly add copyright claims to a document (put in the footer).

            This is an example of a blockquote (pull quote), and how to properly cite it.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         
          <p>
            "Today will be a great day"

          This is an example of an UNordered list.
          <ul>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is an example of an ordered list
          <ol>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List item 3</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is an example of a list with measured attributes. You would use this in an ingredients list, or anywhere you're measuring items.
